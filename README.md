A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

### Run flutter doctor

From a console window that has the Flutter directory in the path (see above), run the following command to see if there are any platform dependencies you need to complete the setup:
```
$flutter doctor
```
And run the following command to begin signing licenses :
```
$flutter doctor --android-licenses
```
- install dart
- install flutter gherkin -> https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gherkin

Use this package as a library to your package's pubspec.yaml
```
$flutter pub get

- create automation code on folder 'test_driver'
- running test :
```
dart .\test_driver\app_test.dart
